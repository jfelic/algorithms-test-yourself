# Algorithms: Test Yourself (Written in Java)

Welcome to my little project that has helped me improve on my understanding and implementation of various common algorithms.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of the Java programming language.

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jfelic/algorithms-test-yourself.git

2. Ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can check your Java version by running:
    ```sh
    java --version

3. Import the Project into your IDE (not necessary if you've been working in the terminal in your IDE)
    ```sh
    IntelliJ IDEA:
    -Open IntelliJ IDEA and select "Open or Import".
    -Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project, select the -project folder, and click "Open".
    -IntelliJ should automatically recognize the project as a Java project and set it up accordingly.

    Eclipse:
    -Open Eclipse and go to "File" > "Import".
    -Choose "Existing Projects into Workspace" under "General", then click "Next".
    -Browse to the cloned project directory, select the project, and click "Finish".

    Visual Studio Code:
    -Open Visual Studio Code.
    -Go to "File" > "Open Folder" and select the cloned project directory.
    -You may need to install the "Java Extension Pack" from the VS Code marketplace for better Java support.

### Have fun!
